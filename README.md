# Offloading Resource-Intensive Tasks to Raspberry Pi (or IoT Devices) Using SSH

This Python script empowers you to offload computationally intensive tasks to a Raspberry Pi or other IoT devices connected to your network, all via SSH. By utilizing this script, you can automate remote task execution and reduce the burden on your primary system.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Python 3.x
- [paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/) library (install with `pip install paramiko`)
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library (install with `pip install python-dotenv`)
- SSH access to the target Raspberry Pi or IoT device with appropriate permissions

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Create a virtual environment (venv) to isolate project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
     OR
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

4. Create a `.env` file within the project directory with the following structure:

   ```plaintext
   server=your_server_hostname
   port=your_ssh_port
   user=your_ssh_username
   password=your_ssh_password
   ```

   Replace `your_server_hostname`, `your_ssh_port`, `your_ssh_username`, and `your_ssh_password` with the actual server details of your Raspberry Pi or IoT device. Use double quotes for the server, user, and password fields in the .env file

5. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Execute the script from the command line, specifying the desired command and its arguments:

```bash
python3 script.py <base command> <arguments>
```

- `<base command>`: The core command you wish to execute remotely (e.g., `python`, `ffmpeg`, `curl`).
- `<arguments>`: Additional arguments or options to accompany the base command.

For instance:

```bash
python3 script.py python my_script.py
```

This will run the `my_script.py` Python script on the Raspberry Pi or IoT device and display the output.

## Features

- **SSH Connectivity**: The script securely establishes an SSH connection with the remote Raspberry Pi or IoT device.

- **Command Verification**: It checks if the specified base command is available on the target device before execution.

- **Remote Execution**: Offload compute-intensive tasks to the remote device, freeing up resources on your primary system.

## Note

- Ensure that you possess valid SSH access rights and permissions for command execution on the Raspberry Pi or IoT device.

- Exercise caution when utilizing this script, especially with potentially resource-intensive tasks, to avoid overloading the remote device.
