Running processes like nmap consumes load of system resource. Hence to outsource the load and automate the nmap tasks, we are using a script to be run on devices connected in the LAN which establishes connection between the clients and raspberry pi (used as a server) and takes the client input domain names/IP addresses as input for nmap scan and runs the command over the server(raspberry pi).
The server can be setup using another script which would automate the configuration of SSH service, generation of result folder along with setting up the python http server in the result folder. Overall an automation for nmap scans, which does not consume the client buffers for the scans and automates the SSH Connection, nmap scan, result fetching, and total configuration.
